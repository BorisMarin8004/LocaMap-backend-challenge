# Coding Challenge Guidelines

## ReadME
Write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:
- Description of the problem and solution.
- Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.
- Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
- Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
- Link to your resume or public profile.
- Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

## Back-end

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them. Therefore, feel free to mention in your README how much experience you have with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.

Also, Please feel free to use any Third Party Resource that makes sense to you. But don't forget to document in the Readme why you chose it and any pros/cons.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

## Host it!

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).

## How will your code be reviewed?

The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

- **Clarity:** does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
- **Correctness:** does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality:** is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- **Technical choices:** do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

### Bonus point (these items are optional)

- **Scalability:** will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README?
- **Production-readiness:** does the code include monitoring? logging? proper error handling?
