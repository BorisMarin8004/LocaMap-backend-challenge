# Coding Challenge Guidelines

## ReadME
Write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:
- Description of the problem and solution.
- Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.
- Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
- Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
- Link to your resume or public profile.
- Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

## How will your code be reviewed?

The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

- **Clarity:** does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
- **Correctness:** does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality:** is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- **Technical choices:** do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

### Bonus point (these items are optional)

- **Scalability:** will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README?
- **Production-readiness:** does the code include monitoring? logging? proper error handling?
