# LocaMap-backend-challenge

Welcome to our Engineering Challenge repository ðŸ––

If you found this repository it probably means that you are participating in our recruitment process. Thank you for your time and energy.

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge, read it careful and take your time and think about the solution. Also, please fork this repository because we will evaluate the code on the fork.

This is an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way. If you have any doubts please open and issue and we'll reach out to help.

## Challenge Objective

At Abord, Travel is the very core of our product. We have deep integrations of maps and locations almost on every screen within the app. Your objective for this challenge is to build an API that takes a latitude and longitude coordinate pair and return with the name of the country.

There are plenty of ways this can be implemented - We only need you to give us one.
Feel free to use any third party resources or APIs as long as you document about it in the ReadME.

> HAVE FUN!!
